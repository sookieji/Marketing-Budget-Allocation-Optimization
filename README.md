# Marketing-Budget-Allocation-Optimization

In today's business landscape, digital marketing has become a crucial component for most companies. However, due to its extensive reach, a seemingly generous marketing budget may quickly prove inadequate. This project aims to assist Super Server Company's marketing department in campaign 
planning and optimizing marketing budget allocations to maximize the impact of their digital marketing efforts.  

Tableau, Excel, Python, and Jupyter Notebook were used to analyze the dataset in this project. Initially, Tableau was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and after dropping some unimportant columns, regression models were run to reach a solution.
